- obsSumStats.pl was using the old format (10 or 11 column formats).
  We removed one of the two Ts/Tv ratio column and gamma rate columns, so
  new input files contains 8 or 9 columns
- in msprior.c, upper limit for ancestral population size was incorrectly
  gParam.upperAncPopSize*gParam.upperTheta*gParam.upperTheta/theta.
  Correct upper limit is gParam.upperAncPopSize*gParam.upperTheta/theta
- README was updated to explain upper ancestral population size better.
- Makefile updated, so one can make static binary with "make STATIC_LINK=YES".
  For Mac OS-X with fink, this cause static linking to gsl, but dynamic link
  to other system libs.

* notes for a version before 20061005 Naoki Takebayashi <ffnt@uaf.edu>
- Modified msprior.[ch] -- gParam.upperTheta (was 40.5) and
  gParam.lowerTheta (was 0.5) is used.
- Modified setup.c
- Modified msprior, so the first element of output line is now upper theta,
  which is required to stat program.
- modified samplesDQH_rej_16tx.c
  Takes option flags, which specify upper bound to theta (-T).
  nadv used to be an argument, but it is changed to option (-a).
- modified msbayes.pl to pass upper theta around
