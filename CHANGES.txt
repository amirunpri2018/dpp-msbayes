Version 0.3.2
=============

Changes
-------

  - Updating to abacus version 0.1.1, which uses a larger line buffer for
    eureject. This will allow analyses with very large numbers of loci.

Version 0.3.1
=============

Changes
-------

  - Updating PERL scripts (msbayes.pl and dpp-msbayes.pl) to use
    File::Temp::tempfile instead of deprecated POSIX::tmpnam.


Version 0.3.0
=============

New Features
------------

  - Adding option to scale time in expected substitutions per site. Use
    ``timeInSubsPerSite 1`` in the configuration file to use this new feature.
    The default (``timeInSubsPerSite 0``) is to use the old scaling
    proportional to the mean of the prior on theta.
  - The coefficient of variation of divergence times is now reported.  This
    unitless statistic is a more useful metric than 'omega' (variance-to-mean
    ratio) for comparisons across models and datasets.

Changes
-------

  - Making three changes to the 'old' msBayes model:
    
    1.  Rescaling time using the mean of the uniform prior on theta (rather
        than half of the upper limit). This now mirrors the dpp code.
    
    2.  As I did for ``dpp-msprior``, I am updating the hack where there was
        a check for small (i.e., 0.0001) divergence times. In such
        simulations, the div time was set to this arbitrary lower bound, and
        the bottleneck time was set to 0.5 of this.  I am guessing this was
        to prevent unrealistic (and numerically unstable?) changes in pop
        size. However, 0.0001 can be thousands of generations which is not
        trivial. Also, rather than this weird hack of the bottleneck time,
        it seems much better to simply have no bottleneck if the div time is
        essentially zero.  Accordingly, I lowered the threshold and simply
        "turn off" the bottleneck if the time is below it (I no longer
        adjust the div time or bottleneck time).
    
    3.  Adding support for ``timeInSubsPerSite`` option, as I did for the
        dpp code. This boolean option in the config allows the user to have
        time in the scale of expected substitutions per site.


Version 0.2.0
=============

Changes
-------
  - Updating ``dpp-msprior``.
    
    Adding a lower bound of "0.000000000001" to all theta parameters, because
    the coalescent simulator ``msDQH`` crashes if theta parameters are zero.
    
    Also, I am updating the weirdness from the original ``msBayes`` where there
    was a check for small (i.e., 0.0001) divergence times. In such simulations,
    the div time was set to this arbitrary lower bound, and the bottleneck time
    was set to 0.5 of this.  I am guessing this was to prevent unrealistic (and
    numerically unstable?) changes in pop size. However, 0.0001 can be
    thousands of generations which is not trivial. Also, rather than this weird
    hack of the bottleneck time, it seems much better to simply have no
    bottleneck if the div time is essentially zero. Accordingly, I lowered the
    threshold and simply "turn off" the bottleneck if the time is below it (I
    no longer adjust the div time or bottleneck time).

Bug Fixes
---------
  - ``msDQH`` would crash if theta was zero. The change above should prevent
    this. If your runs under previous versions did not crash, then you were not
    affected by this bug.


Version 0.1.0
=============

Changes
-------
  - First "official" release of ``dpp-msbayes``.
  - Many changes, new features, and bug fixes from the original ``msBayes``
    code base. Please see the git log for full details; a few changes
    are highlighted below.

New Features
------------
  - A non-parametric Dirichlet process prior on the distribution of divergence
    times across taxon pairs.
  - Gamma and beta distributions on demographic parameters.
  - New "grouping" and "sorting" options for per-taxon summary statistics.
  - Much more control over the parameter richness of the model.
    Parameterization of the population sizes for each taxon is completely
    controllable.  The parameters controlling the timing and severity of
    population bottlenecks can be removed from the model.


Bug Fixes
---------
  - When parsing config files, ``msBayes`` will quietly ignore unrecognized
    options and quietly use default settings (!!). This has been fixed, and
    the program will crash if there are any unrecognized options in the
    configuration file.
  - Many other small fixes.
