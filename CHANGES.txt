Version 0.2.0
=============

Changes
-------
  - Updating ``dpp-msprior``.
    
    Adding a lower bound of "0.000000000001" to all theta parameters, because
    the coalescent simulator ``msDQH`` crashes if theta parameters are zero.
    
    Also, I am updating the weirdness from the original ``msBayes`` where there
    was a check for small (i.e., 0.0001) divergence times. In such simulations,
    the div time was set to this arbitrary lower bound, and the bottleneck time
    was set to 0.5 of this.  I am guessing this was to prevent unrealistic (and
    numerically unstable?) changes in pop size. However, 0.0001 can be
    thousands of generations which is not trivial. Also, rather than this weird
    hack of the bottleneck time, it seems much better to simply have no
    bottleneck if the div time is essentially zero. Accordingly, I lowered the
    threshold and simply "turn off" the bottleneck if the time is below it (I
    no longer adjust the div time or bottleneck time).

Bug Fixes
---------
  - ``msDQH`` would crash if theta was zero. The change above should prevent
    this. If your runs under previous versions did not crash, then you were not
    affected by this bug.


Version 0.1.0
=============

Changes
-------
  - First "official" release of ``dpp-msbayes``.
  - Many changes, new features, and bug fixes from the original ``msBayes``
    code base. Please see the git log for full details; a few changes
    are highlighted below.

New Features
------------
  - A non-parametric Dirichlet process prior on the distribution of divergence
    times across taxon pairs.
  - Gamma and beta distributions on demographic parameters.
  - New "grouping" and "sorting" options for per-taxon summary statistics.
  - Much more control over the parameter richness of the model.
    Parameterization of the population sizes for each taxon is completely
    controllable.  The parameters controlling the timing and severity of
    population bottlenecks can be removed from the model.


Bug Fixes
---------
  - When parsing config files, ``msBayes`` will quietly ignore unrecognized
    options and quietly use default settings (!!). This has been fixed, and
    the program will crash if there are any unrecognized options in the
    configuration file.
  - Many other small fixes.
